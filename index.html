<div class="article"><hgroup><time datetime="2023-11-17">2023-11-17</time><h1>Why Chess is played in Squares but Go (Weiqi) on Intersections</h1></hgroup><p>What caused the difference that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess">Chess</a> is played with pieces placed in squares, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_(game)">Go (Weiqi)</a> is played with stones placed on intersections, despite both games relying on a square grid?</p>
<p>The most reasonable explanation I can think of is <strong>practicality</strong>. Bishops (and queens may) move diagonally; mentally visualizing a diagonal on a plain colorless grid is difficult and error-prone. On a checkered grid, the square colors are a visual aid to help the player make moves correctly, a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parity_bit">parity bit</a>.</p>
<p>Parity is less of a concern for Go. When stones are placed on intersections, liberties (氣; breaths) are visualized by segments of the grid connected to the stone. Furthermore, when the board is filled with hundreds of stones, most of the grid is automatically hidden beneath the stones — whereas if stones had been played in the squares, the grid would have been visible all the time, which is distracting.</p></div>

<div class="article"><hgroup><time datetime="2023-09-21">2023-09-21</time><h1>A Fever Dream</h1></hgroup><p>A review of Mariam Petrosyan's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Gray_House"><em>The Gray House</em></a>.</p>

</blockquote>
<p><em>The Gray House</em> is a truly bizarre book. After reading the ending of this 720-page doorstop, I became utterly conflicted whether it is a rare gem or a stack of nonsense. I believe that almost everyone who read it will either love it dearly or hate it bitterly; very few would be neutral towards it.</p>
<p>The story tells of the titular House towards the end of its lifespan, in which young students marginalized by the society live and learn, and interact with each other. Through funny moments and cozy days we gradually gain a view of the house at different angles, displaying a lovely paradise, a save haven.</p>
<p>Of course, the real story has only just started: as deaths and strange events happen inside the House, a shade of gloominess and mystery covers the atmosphere, and no one is safe from the storm that will alter their lives. The previous Graduation ended in a carnage; with the new, final Graduation arriving soon, the situation accelerates; nobody may tell what will become of them.</p>
<p>But this story is far from a detective or mystery novel. To understand it, you must stop playing the detective: stop trying to analyze it, forming different theories, overthinking. Follow them to a regular meeting at the Coffeepot. Or take a bus trip to the sea. Or read an issue of their internal magazine. Watch and be awed by the house working its magic before you. Most importantly: <strong>hear their backstories and feel for them</strong>.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the book is not hard to follow. The writing is spectacular: despite a huge cast of more than seventy characters, each one is a vivid personality, so much that I can often feel one “pop out of the page” at me. As time pushes on, character names may also change without a two-week notice, but you will always figure out that someone from the present is the same as another from the past, known by another name — because of how clearly depicted they are. Following a narrative of fun sandwiched with melancholy, we see all the metaphor tying together at the end, prompting us to think of fate, and our actions when that time comes.</p>
<p><em>The Gray House</em> is a truly bizarre book. It feels like a fever dream, or these strange images behind your eyelids before you fall asleep. A carnival of merry people and festive beasts parading through the city in colored gowns and loud music, drenched in the sweltering summer heat wave boiling above the asphalt roads. At certain points you may ask: Does the magic truly exist? Is this all an illusion? The answer, however, will come to you naturally. Overall, I really enjoyed the parade, and it would visit me again when the time is right. The metaphor may be different for each person, but for me it has a clear form:</p>

<div class="article"><hgroup><time datetime="2023-04-28">2023-04-28</time><h1>Saphyra: the Beginning</h1></hgroup><p>A few years earlier I started developing <a href="https://github.com/pennzht/saphyra"><strong>Saphyra</strong></a> for fun (called <a href="https://github.com/pennzht/saphira">Saphira</a> then). My main goal was to build a simple proof assistant with a minimal kernel supporting multiple theories. I wanted to see how hard it was, both to build a proof assistant and to write proofs in it.</p>
<p>I restarted the project last year after a three-year hiatus, out of a desire to occupy myself with side projects on weekends. It's a “big clean problem” — one with a very clear goal, plenty of challenges, and an abundance of learning and experimenting opportunities.</p>
<p>Saphyra aims to be a proof assistant, similar to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mizar_system">Mizar</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HOL_(proof_assistant)">HOL</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coq">Coq</a>. The program helps the user to write formal proofs of mathematical theorems that can be automatically verified, and the proof-writing process is also aided by some level of automation.</p>
<p>I aim to make Saphyra …</p>
<ul>
<li>lean:<ul>
<li>The kernel — the program that checks the validity and rigor of proofs — should not exceed 1000 lines of code. The more code you have, the harder it is to verify its correctness.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>extensible:<ul>
<li>The system should be easy to extend to support a wide range of logics: classical, intuitionistic, modal, linear; first-order, second-order, higher-order; set theories, type theories, category theories; and other user-defined systems of reasoning.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>meta:<ul>
<li>The system should be able to prove relations <em>between theories</em>, such as that any EFA theorem is also a PRA theorem, and that ZFC proves the consistency of PA. To do this, we would use a relatively weak theory (such as EFA, PRA, PA, or ZF minus ∞) to show how proofs may be converted between theories.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>easy to use:<ul>
<li>Usability may be improved many ways: using a familiar (Python- or Java-like) syntax; providing analysis tools; training AIs to observe common patterns in proofs; and many others.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
