<div class="article"><hgroup><time datetime="2023-11-17">2023-11-17</time><h1>Why Chess is played in Squares but Go (Weiqi) on Intersections</h1></hgroup><p>What caused the difference that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess">Chess</a> is played with pieces placed in squares, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_(game)">Go (Weiqi)</a> is played with stones placed on intersections, despite both games relying on a square grid?</p>
<p>The most reasonable explanation I can think of is <strong>practicality</strong>. Bishops (and queens may) move diagonally; mentally visualizing a diagonal on a plain colorless grid is difficult and error-prone. On a checkered grid, the square colors are a visual aid to help the player make moves correctly, a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parity_bit">parity bit</a>.</p>
<p>Parity is less of a concern for Go. When stones are placed on intersections, liberties (氣; breaths) are visualized by segments of the grid connected to the stone. Furthermore, when the board is filled with hundreds of stones, most of the grid is automatically hidden beneath the stones — whereas if stones had been played in the squares, the grid would have been visible all the time, which is distracting.</p></div>

| From far, from eve and morning
|     And yon twelve-winded sky,
| The stuff of life to knit me
|     Blew hither: here am I.
|
| Now — for a breath I tarry
|     Nor yet disperse apart —
| Take my hand quick and tell me,
|     What have you in your heart.
|
| Speak now, and I will answer;
|     How shall I help you, say;
| Ere to the wind's twelve quarters
|     I take my endless way.
